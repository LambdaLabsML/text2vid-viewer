# t2v-eval

[t2v-eval.com](https://t2v-eval.com) is a solution to compare state-of-the-art open source text-to-video (T2V) models visually.

Models featured:
* [OpenSora v1.2](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora)
* [CogVideo](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo)
* [PyramidFlow](https://github.com/gasharper/PyramidFlow)

*We are working to include the best open-source T2V models available.*


Take-aways we will explore:
* CogVideo outperforms OpenSora and PyramidFlow
* Things that are most challenging for all models
* Prompt densification is a useful strategy to improve some aspect of performance

## 1. CogVideo outperforms OpenSora and PyramidFlow

## 2. Things most challenging for all models

## 3. Prompt densification is a valuable takeaway
